FT-857D CAT control for Arduino (ft857d)
=======================================

This library give support to any sketch to act as a Yaesu FT-857D radio once you configure it correctly.

For now it's just basic support for the most common uses in HF rig control, that's my goal. This lib can be improved a lot and have a full support for the radio functions if users request it, but for now it meets my goals.


How it works?
=============

You have to define and register a few callback functions with specific parameters that will be called up on CAT commands reception.

It's easy, just see the example sketch.
